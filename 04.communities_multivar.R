# going into the field we take 3 samples and count the number of individuals for 3 different species 
# we use the number of individuals to plot the species on a graph

# since we cannot create plots with more than 3-d (our mind cannot conceive it) we use multivariate analysis
# maybe in one of the dimensions we cannot see some variables that we see as separate are connected
